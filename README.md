# EmmyShi_PSY503_FinalProject
This repo is for Emmy's PSY 503 Final Project. In this repo, Emmy would include a reproducible report, APA-style paper, and eye-tracking data for others to replicate the analysis.

For the repo, there are some core files:
- For reproducing the analysis, you could go to the **EmmyShi_PSY503_FinalProject.rmd**; this file contains all of the analyses, including the power analysis.
- For reading the APA style paper, you could refer to the **pdf file**; you could also read the papaya file in rmd form named **EmmyShi_APAPaper_FinalProject.rmd**
- The data folder contains a RDS files, we use this data to analyze. There is a relative path in the  EmmyShi_PSY503_FinalProject.rmd that points to our data, so I recommend you to **clone my repo to perform the analysis**
